  **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) involves determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of customers. Challenges include optimizing routes to minimize costs, time, and distance while considering constraints like vehicle capacity, delivery windows, and traffic conditions. VRP is crucial in logistics and supply chain management as it enhances operational efficiency, reduces costs, improves customer satisfaction, and contributes to sustainability by lowering fuel consumption and emissions.
